            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics. He was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, in the German Empire. He died on April 18,
                1955, at the age of 76.</p>
